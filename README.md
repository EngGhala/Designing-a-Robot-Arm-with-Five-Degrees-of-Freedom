Step-by-Step Guide to Designing a Robot Arm with Five Degrees of Freedom
1. Start a New Design:
* Visit Tinkercad and click "Create new design" to begin.
2. Create the Base:
* Use a "Cylinder" shape to form the base of the robot arm. This base allows the first degree of freedom (rotation).
3. Design the First Segment (Shoulder):
* Add a "Cylinder" or "Box" shape above the base for the shoulder joint.
* Insert a "Servo Motor" between the base and shoulder for rotational movement.
4. Design the Second Segment (Upper Arm):
* Add a "Box" or "Cylinder" to create the upper arm.
* Place a "Servo Motor" at the shoulder-upper arm joint for lifting movement (second degree of freedom).
5. Design the Third Segment (Elbow):
* Create the elbow joint with a "Cylinder" or "Box" shape.
* Insert another "Servo Motor" at this joint for bending (third degree of freedom).
6. Design the Fourth Segment (Wrist Tilt):
* Create a joint at the wrist using a "Cylinder" or "Box" shape.
* Add a "Servo Motor" for tilting movement (fourth degree of freedom).
7. Design the Gripper or End-Effector:
* Choose a suitable gripper from the available shapes in Tinkercad that fit your design.
* Add a "Servo Motor" to control the gripper's opening and closing (fifth degree of freedom).
8. Align and Adjust Components:
* Ensure all components are properly aligned for smooth motion.
9. Save and Finalize the Design:
* Save your work in Tinkercad.
